# AutoDeploy

AutoDeploy is a Python script that automates the process of deploying a combined library by integrating multiple repositories and optimizing the code.

## Features

- **Code Optimization**: The script applies various optimization techniques to the combined code to enhance its efficiency and performance. It removes dead code, simplifies complex expressions, utilizes efficient data structures and algorithms, minimizes I/O operations, leverages built-in functions and libraries, employs caching techniques, and profiles critical sections for performance improvements.

- **Library Integration**: AutoDeploy facilitates the integration of multiple repositories into a single combined library. It analyzes the code and dependencies of each repository, identifies overlapping code segments, and generates a final library with non-overlapping and optimized code.

- **Auto Crediting**: The script automatically credits the repositories and libraries used in the combined code. It forks the respective repositories and adds comments based on the license type. This helps give credit to the original authors and maintain compliance with open-source licenses.

- **Deployment**: AutoDeploy streamlines the deployment process of the combined library. It provides an automated workflow to package and distribute the library, making it easier for users to deploy and utilize the consolidated functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use AutoDeploy, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x: The script requires Python to run. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Git: Git is required to clone repositories and perform version control operations. You can download Git from: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installation

1. Clone the AutoDeploy repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/reconsumeralization/AutoDeploy.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd AutoDeploy
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Place the Python files from the repositories you want to combine into the project directory.

2. Run the AutoDeploy script. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the AutoDeploy directory. Execute the following command:

   ```shell
   python AutoDeploy.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information for the deployment process. The script will guide you through the integration, optimization, and deployment steps.

4. AutoDeploy will analyze the code, optimize it using various techniques, credit the repositories and libraries used, and deploy the final combined library.

### Running Tests

After making changes, run the unit tests using `pytest`:

```shell
pytest -q
```
